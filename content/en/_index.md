        Red's ambitious goal is to build the world's first full-stack language:
        one you can use from system programming tasks up to high-level
        scripting, using domain-specific, homoiconic language.

    content: "Red is more like a "language construction set" than simply "a language." Whether youâ€™re writing a device driver, a platform-native GUI application, or a shared library, Red's flexibility lets you use a common syntax to code at the right level of abstraction for the task."
